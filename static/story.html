            I should probably say first that this project will be a "little" different than most.
             I used Go for the main backend and Google Sheet for the database. Wait, what? Why Google Sheet, you may ask?
            <br><br>
            I don't have any fancy setup in my cloud accounts for backend development.
             You see, I'm not really into the idea of buying a cloud service just to run a SQL Database for a free scholarship project,
             so I'm looking for an alternative. No, I don't want to use any of that free SQL websites. 
             I can't even get an account due to a 500 on their site.
            <br><br>
            So, I'm trying to make this work with Google Sheet + Apps Script. It's easy to set up,
             plus I believe this can be a good experience for my future project as everybody use Google Sheet nowadays.
             As the more lines I coded, I learned why no one used it as their primary database.
             The database limitations that I'm aware of:
            <ul>
              <li>Bad performance. I got the response after 10 secs on average for reading around 15K rows,</li>
              <li>I have no other idea except it has a truly been slow response</li>
            </ul>
            But the best part is, you got a Google Sheet.
            <br><br>
            <b>Does this project meet the requirements of the challenge?</b><br>
            I tried my best to follow the rules:
            <ul>
              <li>Use Go as the primary language for the backend,</li>
              <li>The requirements aren't telling us what we need to use as the database hence the use of Google Sheet,</li>
              <li>This project has all of the required attributes for every definition,</li>
              <li>Some of the places are user-generated when the majority comes from a real dataset,</li>
              <li>Has "/search" route for searching nearby places inside 5 Km radius along with accurate response model,</li>
              <li>Uploaded to Github and deployed to Heroku</li>
            </ul>
            Even if this project doesn't check all the requirements yet,
             your understanding of my decision is greatly appreciated.
             I hope you learned something positive from this project as I do.
             Anyway, thanks for reading this, and have a nice day.
